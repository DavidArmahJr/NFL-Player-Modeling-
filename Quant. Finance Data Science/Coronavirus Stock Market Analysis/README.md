## Introduction

This project takes a look into how the Coronavirus Pandemic impacted Financial Markets. Looking at various stock's prices before, during, and after periods of time when the Pandemic was issued.

## Research Problem

We know how much the Global Coronavirus Pandemic has affected the lives of everyone throughout the world. The Coronavirus changed how we all choose to live our lives, which led to many many drastic changes to the financial markets, such as the Stock Market in particular. Since the Stock market reflects perceptions of people and the companies that fundamentally run our country, I decided to look into how it was affected by the pandemic. Knowing this,  I needed to analyze and answer these following questions:

1. How did the stock prices for different sectors of business, as well as Crypto Markets, get affected by COVID-19 global pandemic?
2. Was there a statistical difference in each sector's stock prices before and during the COVID-19 global pandemic
3. Which sector was the most profitable to invest in
4. What market is the best to invest in post pandemic?
5. Create a forecasting model for interesting Stocks

In order to answer such questions, I will compare Stocks in different sectors that represent the entire Stock Market, as well as looking at the most popular Cryptocurrencies in the Crypto Markets, a year before and after the pandemic, while also keeping up with important dates that affected the financial markets throughout the pandemic as well.
