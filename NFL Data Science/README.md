## Introduction 

For the past couple years, one of my favorite activities is building projects that allow me to scrape sports data from the web that can be used to analyze specific data in order to make predictions on specific outcomes. Sports has always been an interest of mine growing up and utilizing technology also is one of my passions, so being able to combine those two always is fun for me.

## General Project Steps

### Exploration/ Data Collection

I first started by looking at various data sources and deciding where I wanted to scrape my data from. I have scraped from [Pro football Reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/) in the past, which has required a lot of maintence because their website is always changing, but I plan to make it soon, but for this project the source I am retreiving my data from is [football db](https://www.footballdb.com/)

### Data Processing

Automated processes to build connection to retreive data from specific website pages using BeautifulSoup and requests packages. Stored data in pandas dataframes

### Data Cleaning

Renamed columns, edited row values that contained unnecesary characters, changed data types of columns

### Data Analysis

Analyzed averages of statistics, compared various statistics, relationships between specific stats, etc. 


### Modeling Development

Various Models used to predict performance
